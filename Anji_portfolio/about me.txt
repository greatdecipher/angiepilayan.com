A Little About Myself

I am a graduating student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Financial Management degree. In this course, I learned how to analyze Financial Statements, risk management, and how to make rational financial and investment decisions.

 When I was in my second year of college, I began working in the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry to help pay for my college expenses and to advance my career.

I enjoy working in the industry for 3 years, most recently as a Senior Call Center Associate at Open Access BPO. I have valuable skills such as general Virtual assistant, Computer proficiency and leadership experience, that I believe qualify me for the position of Call Center Associate.

Alongside this, I was appointed as a secretary in our Junior Financial Executive organization, where I wrote letters for special events and attended meetings to take notes for the minutes of meeting.

It was challenging for me to study and work at the same time because productivity and consistency require time management. As a hardworking and dedicated individual, and with the help and support of my family, colleagues, and leaders, I am nearly at the point in my life where I will finally walk up on stage and receive my reward, diploma.

My main goal is to empower students' learning as well as the advancement of skills that will allow them to draw intelligent conclusions on their own. All of their approaches can be encouraged through innovative planning.

Above all, I value clarity, empathy, and integrity. These ideals shape how I approach problem solving and life in general.
